Analysis on Udemy Courses 

This project involves an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information about Udemy courses. Leveraging the Python programming language and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this analysis showcases the distribution and trends of various course attributes such as subject, level, pricing, subscribers, reviews, and publication years. The project demonstrates how EDA techniques can uncover valuable insights from raw data and present them visually through plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and more

Key Features:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Utilization of Pandas to read and clean the dataset, handling missing values and duplicates.
Visualizing Distribution: Seaborn and Matplotlib employed to visualize the distribution of subjects, course levels, and pricing using count plots and bar charts.
Subscriber Analysis: Investigation into the relationship between subscription numbers and course attributes using scatter plots and bar plots.
Popular Courses: Identification of the most popular courses based on subscribers and reviews, with corresponding visualizations.
Time Trends: Analysis of the publication years of courses, revealing the year with the highest course offerings.
